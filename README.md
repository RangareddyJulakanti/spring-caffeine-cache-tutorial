Tutorial code for Spring Caching with Caffeine Cache with the help of Spring Boot.

Teaches you how to setup Spring Caching with Caffeine Cache with the help of Spring Boot.
We start by taking a look at the configuration needed to setup Spring Caching
and then then quickly dive into Caffeine Cache specifics; Its features, configuration
properties, different ways to configure it via JavaConfig and go into
why its a solid choice over other local cache implementations available.
The tutorial also provides a high level overview of the 
Spring Cache annotations @Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict, @Caching and @CacheConfig.

Note: You will need a default instance of mongodb running (with out of the box config)
for this project to run.
